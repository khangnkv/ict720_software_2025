1. Parents with children
2. Babysitter

# User Stories
1. User 1: As a parent, I want to know when my baby needs care at night but I need rest too, so I want to sleep without worry
2. User 2: As another parent, I want to check my babysitter whether he or she take care of my child properly during my working hours, for I am not available at home, and it is risky if the babysitter does something wrong without notifying
3. User 3: As a different parent, I want to review recorded video and audio from the camera to ensure my child was properly cared for throughout the day.
4. User 4: As a babysitter, I want to be alerted if the babyâ€™s room temperature or humidity level becomes uncomfortable so I can adjust the environment for their well-being during my shift.
