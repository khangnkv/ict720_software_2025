# Objective
  The objective of this project is to develop a baby monitoring system using the M5StickC and HAT Yun device, which detects motion and environmental changes and sends real-time notifications/aleart to parents through a Telegram bot. The system will ensure that parents are promptly informed when their baby wakes up or moves and will provide environmental data like temperature, humidity, and air pressure from the HAT Yun sensor. Additionally, the system will send an image from the T-SIMCAM ESP32-S3 when motion is detected, giving parents a complete view of the room’s current situation. This solution aims to provide peace of mind to parents by offering real-time alerts and live environmental monitoring in an efficient and timely manner.

# User Stories
1. User 1: As a parent, I want to know when my baby needs care at night but I need rest too, so I want to sleep without worry
2. User 2: As another parent, I want to check my babysitter whether he or she take care of my child properly during my working hours, for I am not available at home, and it is risky if the babysitter does something wrong without notifying
3. User 3: As a different parent, I want to review recorded video and audio from the camera to ensure my child was properly cared for throughout the day.
4. User 4: As a babysitter, I want to be alerted if the baby’s room temperature or humidity level becomes uncomfortable so I can adjust the environment for their well-being during my shift.
